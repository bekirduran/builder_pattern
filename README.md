# Builder Pattern Example
### The Builder Pattern is a creational pattern whose intent is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that you can use the same construction process to create different representations.
### Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
